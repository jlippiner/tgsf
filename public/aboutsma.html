                                                                    <p>

Specifically, the disease is caused by an abnormal or missing gene known as the survival motor neuron gene (SMN1), which is responsible for the production of a protein essential to motor neurons. Without this protein, lower motor neurons in the spinal cord degenerate and die. As the motor neuron network breaks down, the ability of the brain to control muscles diminishes and with less control and use, muscles weaken and waste away. Simply, SMA eventually impacts every muscle in the body hindering the ability to walk, sit, stand, eat, breathe, and swallow. The mind always remains unaffected and children with SMA remain bright, sensitive, and playful in spite of their failing body.

These people are referred to as “carriers”. Non-carriers have two healthy copies of the SMN1 gene. But, carriers have one healthy SMN1 copy and one defective, mutated SMN1 copy. The one healthy SMN1 gene is more than sufficient to direct the production of SMN protein in carriers. However, when two carriers have a child, that child randomly gets one SMN1 gene from each parent: 25% of the time that child receives two healthy SMN1 genes (one from each parent); 50% of the time that child gets one healthy SMN1 gene and one defective SMN1 gene; and 25% of the time that child gets two defective SMN1 genes. It is this last 25%, where the child is passed two defective, mutated SMN1 genes, in which the active form of SMA occurs and the child is left without the functioning SMN1 gene that is responsible for the production of a protein essential to motor neurons. Most couples that have a child with the active form of SMA had no prior family history of the disease.

<h1>About Us</h1><p>The Gwendolyn Strong Foundation (GSF) was born out of Bill and Victoria Strongâ€™s firsthand experience with their precious daughter, Gwendolyn. Gwendolyn was born perfectly healthy in October 2007, but was diagnosed with the terminal disease Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) Type I at 6-months-old.</p><p>As witnesses to the degenerative cruelty of SMA, Bill and Victoria are personally and passionately dedicated to leaving no stone unturned in raising awareness about and funding research for SMA and supporting families who are impacted by SMA and other life-altering diseases.</p>
